What is BinderHub?
------------------

**BinderHub** allows you to ``BUILD`` and ``REGISTER`` a Docker image from a
Git repository, then ``CONNECT`` with JupyterHub, allowing you to create a
public IP address that allows users to interact with the code and environment
within a live JupyterHub instance. You can select a specific branch name,
commit, or tag to serve.

BinderHub ties together:

- `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ to provide
  a scalable system for authenticating users and spawning single user
  Jupyter Notebook servers, and

- `Repo2Docker <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker>`_ which generates
  a Docker image using a Git repository hosted online.

BinderHub is built with Python, kubernetes, tornado, npm, webpack, and sphinx.


Documentation
-------------

For more information about the architecture, use, and setup of BinderHub, see
`the BinderHub documentation <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_.


Contributing
------------

To contribute to the BinderHub project you can work on:

* `answering questions others have <https://discourse.jupyter.org/>`_,
* writing documentation,
* designing the user interface, or
* writing code.

To see how to build the documentation, edit the user interface or modify the
code see `the contribution guide <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.


Installation
------------

**BinderHub** is based on Python 3, it's currently only hosted on GitHub
(pip release soon). However, it can be installed using ``pip``::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub

See `the BinderHub documentation <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_ for
a detailed guide on setting up your own BinderHub server.


Why BinderHub?
--------------

Collections of Jupyter notebooks are becoming more common in scientific research
and data science. The ability to serve these collections on demand enhances the
usefulness of these notebooks.


Who is BinderHub for?
---------------------
* **Users** who want to easily interact with computational environments that
  others have created.
* **Authors** who want to create links that allow users to immediately interact with a
  computational enviroment that you specify.
* **Deployers** who want to create their own BinderHub to run on whatever
  hardware they choose.
